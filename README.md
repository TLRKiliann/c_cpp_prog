# C/C++

1. C
2. C++

## 2 dossiers (C/C++)

After 2 weeks on the C language, I wondered what C++ was like. Then I realized that there wasn't much difference between C and C++.

So I thought why not try to go further with class, class inheritance, class methods, the constructor and specific calls.

So I'm going to make a few programs with class and use GTK for graphics rendering in both C and C++.

I used GTK3 with C to display a window with button input to change the display of the text.

I made a stock management system program in C++.

I'll be back !
